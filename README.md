# Buying-Cars-webpage
To create a webpage that allows customers to choose car options, submit their information, and store it in a database using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript, you can follow these steps:

# 1.Set up your environment:
Create a folder for your project.
Inside the folder, create the following files:
index.html (for the webpage)
style.css (for styling)
process.php (for handling form submission and database storage)

# 2.HTML (index.html) 

# 3.CSS (style.css)

# 4.PHP (process.php)

# 5.JavaScript (script.js): You can add JavaScript for client-side validation if needed.
Now, when a user fills out the form and selects car options, the data will be submitted to the process.php script, which will sanitize the data and store it in a database table named customer_data. Make sure to replace the database credentials and table name with your own.

Don't forget to set up a database and table to store this data before testing the form.
